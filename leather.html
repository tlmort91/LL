  <p style="font-weight: bold; "> About </p>
  <p>I learnt how to do some plaiting when I was about 12, and since then have continued to tinker around with it. To me its a good hobby, but also a good reminder about the effort required to make quality, timeless products. Something that appears to be amiss in todays society. I took it quiet serisouly a couple of years ago but have since pulled back and only do it for gifts or when trading with people who make me something in return. I will also contemplate making products for people who pay me in bitcoin. Belts: 0.02 BTC, watchbands: 0.01 BTC. Lanyards are limited edition. </p>
