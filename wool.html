    <p><strong><span style="text-align: inherit;">Economics: a lesson from the wool industry</span></strong></p>
    <p><span style="text-align: inherit;"><em>"Capitalism without failure is like religion without hell" &ndash; Charlie Munger</em></span></p>
    <p><span style="text-align: inherit;"><em>"Always be prepared to think that experts are stupid. They often are." &mdash; Jane Jacobs</em></span></p>
    <p><span style="text-align: inherit;"><em>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</em></span></p>
    <p><span style="text-align: inherit;">In 1974, the Australian Wool Commission set a reserve price for wool in order to provide a more stable income for wool growers. 17 years later in 1991, the scheme collapsed under its own weight.</span></p>
    <p><span style="text-align: inherit;">The outcomes were disastrous. Our international customers had gone broke from high prices in the lead up to the collapse, reducing demand. Farmers had over produced 4-6 million bales of wool that was stockpiled and took until 2001 to clear (our current production is about 1.5m bales/yr). Worse still, farmers had to shoot thousands of worthless sheep.</span></p>
    <p><span style="text-align: inherit;">All in all the failed scheme cost our government (read taxpayers) an estimated $12 billion dollars in today's terms [1].</span></p>
    <p><span style="text-align: inherit;">As Charlie Massey aptly wrote in his book on the topic:</span></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>''The wool leadership all were all guilty of group-think and started behaving like the white shoe brigade from the Gold Coast: the good times would never end and they could go on living on borrowed money paid for by somebody else, taxes paid for by woolgrowers. And damn the customers. They could pay whatever they told them to pay.</p>
    <p>The hubris was stupendous. Still is.''</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span style="text-align: inherit;">Australian farmers learnt a valuable lesson: letting governments (or any central authority) intervene in markets, no matter how well intentioned, can end in disaster [2]. <br /></span></p>
    <p><span style="text-align: inherit;">While the intervention in the wool market was quite obvious in hindsight, I've often wondered if interventions of price mechanism's in other markets will end up with similar outcomes. One such market that I've been learning alot about lately is the market of money.</span></p>
    <p><span style="text-align: inherit;">In this market, it is central banks all around the world that have been manipulating the price of money for a number of years now. How so?</span></p>
    <ul>
    <li style="text-align: inherit;"><span style="text-align: inherit;">The abandonment of the gold standard in 1971</span></li>
    <li style="text-align: inherit;"><span style="text-align: inherit;">The artificial lowering of interest rates since the late 80's.</span></li>
    <li style="text-align: inherit;"><span style="text-align: inherit;">Printing of money via quantitative easing since 2008.<br /></span></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="text-align: inherit;">While all these mechanism's were and still are implemented with very good intentions according to mainstream economic thinking (Keynesian economics), it doesn't change the fact that the price of money (read interest rate) has been manipulated by a central authority, rather than let the free market decide its price.</span></p>
    <p><span style="text-align: inherit;">Heeding the lessons from the reserve wool price scandal, one wonders whether or not the articifical manipulation of the money supply will end with a different result?</span></p>
    <p><span style="text-align: inherit;">If the punters look close enough, they will begin to connect the dots of the impacts that these distortions have already had in rural communities. For example, some questions worth pondering:</span></p>
    <ul>
    <li style="text-align: inherit;"><span style="text-align: inherit;">Why have farms seemingly gotten so expensive relative to their production value? </span></li>
    <li style="text-align: inherit;"><span style="text-align: inherit;">Can interest rates keep going down forever?</span></li>
    <li style="text-align: inherit;"><span style="text-align: inherit;">Why is the quality of the tools and machinery we buy today seemingly not built to last like they used to be?</span></li>
    <li style="text-align: inherit;"><span style="text-align: inherit;">Why are we seeing an influx of investors looking to park money in ag and water assets?</span></li>
    <li style="text-align: inherit;"><span style="text-align: inherit;">Why do we have to strive for economic efficiency from our farmland, and shun all qualitative aspects? e.g. the environment, community etc.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="text-align: inherit;">Perhaps the economists are right and they have to distort the price of money to ensure a prosperous society. But I can't help but think that meddling with the price of money is no different to meddling with the price of wool. As the saying goes: the road to hell is paved with good intentions. <br /></span></p>

    <p><span style="text-align: inherit;">[1] <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/shrunken-industry-fleeced-by-politics-and-greed-20110729-1i4at.html">https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/shrunken-industry-fleeced-by-politics-and-greed-20110729-1i4at.html</a></span></p>
    <p><span style="text-align: inherit;">[2] We have learnt this lesson in other domains:</span></p>
    <ul>
    <li style="text-align: inherit;"><span style="text-align: inherit;">Tax schemes which distorted land prices and led to farmland being converted to pine forests, vineyards, and sandalwood plantations. Consequently which have failed. A few examples: Wilmott Forrests, Gunn Timber, Timbercorp, Quintis (formerly TFS)</span></li>
    <li style="text-align: inherit;"><span style="text-align: inherit;">Sugar growers whose international prices have been stymied by subsidies from Indian and Thai governments. </span></li>
    <li style="text-align: inherit;"><span style="text-align: inherit;">Chickpea and barley growers who have to deal with export tariffs into previsouly lucrative markets (India &amp; China)</span></li>
    </ul>
